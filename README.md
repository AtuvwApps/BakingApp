# BakingApp
Baking App was another project I completed during the Android Developer Nanodegree with Udacity.
The app pulls in the baking recipe details from JSON using Retrofit. The user selects a recipe to view details of it.
The ingredients and steps are displayed using RecyclerViews. Exoplayer is used to show videos included in some of the recipe steps.
Fragments are used to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
